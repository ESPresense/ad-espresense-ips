# ESPresense - Ips Solver
## Installation

In order to get this to work on the docker version of AppDaemon you 
should use [this](https://hub.docker.com/r/dtterastar/appdaemon) 
image. Its a bit out of date but it's based off of buster instead of
alpine so it makes installing the python dependencies much easier. 
With this you shouldn't need to add any system packages.
